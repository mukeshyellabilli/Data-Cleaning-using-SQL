# Data Cleaning Portfolio Project: SQL Queries

This project demonstrates data cleaning techniques using SQL, specifically for a dataset named `NashvilleHousing`. It involves tasks like standardizing data formats, handling null values, and updating records to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Project Overview

The `NashvilleHousing` dataset contains housing data that requires preprocessing to make it analysis-ready. This project applies a series of SQL queries to clean and standardize the data.

### Key Objectives:
- Standardize date formats for consistency.
- Handle missing values effectively.
- Correct data inconsistencies.
- Optimize the dataset for downstream analysis.

## SQL Tasks Included

### 1. Standardizing Date Formats
- Converted `SaleDate` to a standard date format using `CONVERT`.
- Updated records to reflect the standardized format.

### 2. Handling Null Values
- Added a new column `SaleDateConverted` to accommodate transformations.
- Populated missing values with appropriate substitutions or placeholders.

### 3. Data Corrections
- Implemented updates to fix data inconsistencies in various fields.

### 4. Data Optimization
- Adjusted table schema to support data integrity and usability.

## Prerequisites
- SQL Server or any database software that supports T-SQL.
- Access to the `NashvilleHousing` dataset within the `PortfolioProject.dbo` schema.

## How to Use

### 1. Set Up the Environment
- Import the `NashvilleHousing` dataset into your SQL environment.
- Ensure it resides in the `PortfolioProject.dbo` schema.

### 2. Run SQL Queries
- Execute the queries sequentially as outlined in the file to clean the data.

### 3. Verify Results
- After running each query, inspect the table to confirm the intended changes.

## Files
- **`Data Cleaning Portfolio Project Queries.sql`**: Contains all SQL queries used for cleaning the dataset.

## Future Enhancements
- Automating the cleaning process using stored procedures.
- Extending the project to handle additional datasets.
- Visualizing cleaned data with BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.
